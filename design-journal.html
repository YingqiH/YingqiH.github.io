        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: By the end of the term, I hope I can create a website independently, learn more about HTML and CSS, and code as much as possible. How to design an interesting portfolio website is one of my biggest goals in this course. I don't expect myself to build a very complex and fancy website, but I wish I can remember the basic language skilfully.

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project 1, I plan to build a website about tea, which I will display different information about tea through different pages, such as different types of tea, the benefits of tea, and how to make a perfect cup of tea. I'm going to split the page into two columns, one side with fixed information and scrollable images on the other. I will use the same format for each page, but different photos. This allows each page to be unique while maintaining the integrity of the website. The color of the whole site, I will pick a warm color theme, so that visitors feel the warmth brought by tea.

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: This week’s journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you; it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like? Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.
        </p>
        <p>Response: As one of the biggest beverages in the world, I guess most people are familiar with tea. If a young girl who has first contact with tea and visits my website, she will find out that drinking tea can not only make her skin better, but also make her body healthier. Then she may have a great interest in tea, at the same time, she can learn the right process to make tea on the website. I think most young girls are irresistible to all kinds of ways to be beautiful.</p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Why did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? What bothers you about them? How will you improve things in your own design?</p>
        <p>Response: One of the main reasons I chose La Rosé Pâtisserie's webpage for redesign was that the original website did not perfectly fit the theme of their store. When I redesign, I will focus on the layout of the menu. I think as a food website, the menu page is the key. I will simplify the background and other elements as much as possible. Design a clean and tidy dessert web page.</p>
        <p>I put the original website for this week.</p>

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Read this article on mobile-first design and share your thoughts on mobile-first vs desktop first. https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00</p>
        <p>Response: In today's society, the rapid development of the Internet has brought about a series of changes. Graphic design has also developed from 2D to multidimensional, from paper to screen. In the article, we know that the utilization rate of mobile phones is much higher than that of computers now. In order to follow this development, our designers have gradually shifted their focus from web design to mobile screen design. I think this change is inevitable. Perhaps in the next ten years, our design focus will continue to shift to other places. </p>
